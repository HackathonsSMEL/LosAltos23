# LosAltos23
Project for Los Altos Hacks 2023

This project is a google extension that recognizes the important parts of an online passage or article using an ML software and gives the user the option to either highlight, underline, or bold those important parts. 

The items in the js folder take the passage or article from the chrome tab in and then use the OpenAI API to determine what the important parts in them are. 
The items in the popup folder contain the front end development code. They dictate how the extension looks to the user and how the user interacts with the extension.
